# Expanding Formatter

This module provides a formatter for existing text, long text and text with
summary widget types. This module allows you to change how the content is being
displayed (formatted) by providing new format types:

 - Trimmed (expandable)
 - Summary or Trimmed (expandable)

## Features

- CSS Transition effects:
  - None (just toggle visibility immediately)
  - Fade
  - Slide
- Customizable/themable ellipsis
- Customizable labels for trigger (collapsible, if you need to create a toggle)
- Customizable classes on trigger

## How to use this module:

Enable the module and go to your content type's display
(e.g. `admin/structure/types/manage/page/display`). You will see fields
(like `Body`) that allow you to adjust the `Format` â€“ you can now choose
"Trimmed (expandable)". Once you've selected this format, you will have
additional configuration options.
